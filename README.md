# A Music Recommendation System

Capstone Project for the Applied Data Science Program, MIT Professional Education

Humans are in a constant race against time, with ever-increasing busy lives. 
The volume of music available to us is contantly increasing, making the task of searching for new music to listen to daunting, 
at the very least.

The problem we are addressing here is using data science to build a recommendation system capable of proposing the top 10 songs to a user, 
based on the likelihood that said user will be listening to those songs.

Building a recommendation system based on our unique musical preferences, 
able to assist us in the process of finding new music to explore, will benefit us by enriching our lives.

In order for us to build a recommendatio system, we need to answer a few key questions, listed below.

    - How do we define the musical preference of a user?

    - What factors contribute to a user's musical preference?

    - What data is the most useful when defining the preference of a user?

    - What is the musical content that a user is most likely to consume?

Depending on the data available to us, answering these question may reveal different answers. 
Data scientists are striving to build a reliable recommendation system, one that is accurate, fast and inexpensive.

Musical tastes are very personal, and recommending new songs to a user is not an easy task, by any measure. 
Ultimately, any user can benefit from having a reliable recommendation system, capable of making fast and accurate recommendations!
